# Timetable for the setup of e15507

### Outstanding questions
- [ ] When will Greg move his stuff out of S2?
  - Kyle emailing Mark? and Greg
- [x] Need a beamline -> iso 100 adapter to couple chamber, and Hornet
  - Will get Friday
- [ ] When can we borrow the Masytecs from Thomas?
  - Kyle asking
- [x] Is there someone who can be in charge of the electronics?
  - The DAQ config is already written and the control of HV for IC and MCP is solved downstream
  - Chenyang and Fanurs
- [x] When will we get the HPGe?
  - Hopefully Friday before 6/14
